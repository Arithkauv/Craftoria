# Rarities

Every affix item has a <Color id="blue">Rarity</Color> associated with it. The rarity of the item determines how strong it will be, and what affixes will be applied to it.

A higher rarity is always stronger than the last.

## Common

A <Color hex="#808080">Common</Color> item is the most basic type of affix item.  Each one will always have a single stat bonus, and has a low chance to gain a second.

## Uncommon

An <Color hex="#33FF33">Uncommon</Color> item is a step up from a common item, but still doesn't get any unique effects. These items always have two stat bonuses, and may receive a third.

They may also receive a single socket.

## Rare

<Color hex="#5555FF">Rare</Color> items are where affixes begin to shine. These items receive three stat bonuses and a special effect, and may receive a second effect.

They may also receive a socket, and always have a slight durability bonus.

## Epic

<Color hex="#BB00BB">Epic</Color> items are on the cusp of greatness. They receive three stats and an effect, and may receive a fourth stat and second effect.

They may also receive up to two sockets, and have a stronger durability bonus.

## Mythic

<Color hex="#ED7014">Mythic</Color> items were forged by a lost entity of great power. They receive four stats and two effects, and may receive a third effect as well as three sockets.

They also carry a significant durability bonus.
