# Boss Dungeons

Located deep in the ancient caverns of the earth are hidden structures, housing the untold power of the affixes. It would be a welcome surprise if that power was free for the taking, but alas, it is instead defended by a Boss.

Found underground are a few different variants of structures known as Boss Dungeons.  Each dungeon contains a boss spawner and a few loot chests.  The spawner will trigger upon getting close to it, unleashing the contained boss.
