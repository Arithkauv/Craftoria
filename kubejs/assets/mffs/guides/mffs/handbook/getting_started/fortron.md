# Fortron

Fortron is a form of energy that MFFS machines use as a source of power. It is produced and stored initially by the [Coercion Deriver](../coercion_deriver.md) to then be transferred to other machines by the [Fortron Capacitor](../fortron_capacitor.md).

Another source of Fortron energy is a creative-only item known as the <Color id="dark_purple">Infinite Power Card</Color>. It can be placed directly into a [Fortron Capacitor](../fortron_capacitor.md) (left most item slot) to provide an infinite supply of Fortron. Fortron is able to exist as a liquid. It may be pumped directly from a Capacitor and manipulated in the same way Water or Lava can.
