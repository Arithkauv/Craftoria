# Gem Cutting

The <Color id="blue">Gem Cutting Table</Color> is used to upgrade [Gems](./gems.md).

Upgrading a gem costs <Color id="blue">Gem Dust</Color>, <Color id="blue">Rarity Materials</Color>, and a second Gem of the same rarity.

<Recipe id="apotheosis:gem_cutting_table" />

## Upgrade Costs

The cost of upgrading a Gem increases with its Rarity.

Stronger gems require more <Color id="blue">Gem Dust</Color> and higher-tier <Color id="blue">Rarity Materials</Color>.

The exact cost will be shown in the GUI.
