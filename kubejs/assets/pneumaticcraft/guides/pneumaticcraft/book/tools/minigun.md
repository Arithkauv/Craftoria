# Minigun

The *Minigun* is a handheld weapon, which runs on [compressed air](../pressure.md) and [Gun Ammo](./minigun_ammo.md). Ammo needs to be inserted into the [Minigun's magazine](./minigun_ammo.md#magazine) - it will not be consumed from the player's inventory.

To fire the minigun, simply hold *right-click*. The barrel will start to spin and will fire as soon as it is up to speed.

## Upgrading

Many features (spin-up speed, range, potion proc chance...) of the *Minigun* are upgradable in a [Charging Station](../charging_station.md).

Full documentation on each upgrade and its effects is available in the Charging Station's upgrade GUI.
