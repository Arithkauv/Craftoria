# Charging Station

The *Charging Station* is a machine in which [pneumatic items](../base_concepts/pressure.md) can be charged (or discharged). The interaction between the *Charging Station* and pneumatic items is the same as for the interaction between tubes/machines: differences in pressures will be equalized. This means that you'll need a well-pressurized *Charging Station* to charge items fully.

<ItemImage id="pneumaticcraft:charging_station" />

Most charged items have a maximum pressure of 10 bar. Don't worry about explosions though; items will not explode due to overcharging, but simply stop charging beyond 10 bar.

The *Charge Pad* can be camouflaged with a [Camouflage Applicator](../tools/camo_applicator.md).

## Charge Pad

You can turn the *Charging Station* into a *Charge Pad* by inserting a [Dispenser Upgrade](../base_concepts/upgrades.md#dispenser). This will (de)pressurize:
- items lying on the ground on top of the Charging Station
- items carried by players standing on the Charging Station
- all types of [Drone](../tools/drone.md) which are directly above the Charging Station

## Upgrade Management

The *Charging Station* also functions as a management system for items which accept [upgrades](../base_concepts/upgrades.md). To upgrade an item, put it in the *Charging Station* as usual, and click the *up-arrow* button just above the item slot. This opens a new GUI where upgrades can be inserted; every applicable upgrade for the item in question is documented in a GUI side tab.
