# Force Field Projector

<ItemImage id="mffs:projector" />

The <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color> is a fundamental part of the MFFS family of machines. It uses Fortron energy to project force fields of various shapes and sizes into the world.

Crafting the <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color>.

<Recipe id="mffs:projector" />

## Usage

To make a force field, give the <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color> a supply of [Fortron](../fortron.md) by linking it to a nearby [Fortron Capacitor](./fortron_capacitor.md). This can be achieved either by:
- Right-clicking the <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color> and entering the matching frequency number into its GUI screen
- Shift-right-clicking the Projector while holding a [Frequency Card](../frequency_card.md).

Decide which force field shape to create by crafting one of the [projector mode items](../projector_modes.md). Right-click the Projector and place the projector mode item into the central (red) slot surrounded by outwardly facing arrows. Craft a number of [<Color id="dark_purple">Scale Module</Color>](../scale_module.md) items and place them into the left-hand slot matrix of the <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color>'s GUI. Each [<Color id="dark_purple">Scale Module</Color>](../scale_module.md) used in the Projector's matrix slots will increase the force field radius by one block.

The number at the bottom of the GUI indicates how much Fortron is required to sustain a force field of the specified size and shape. Activate the Projector by supplying it with a Redstone signal. Once activated, the <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color> will change from red to blue and begin projecting a force field (assuming it has enough available [Fortron](../fortron.md)).

To be able to walk through a force field, a [Biometric Identifier](./biometric_identifier.md) is needed.

## Upgradability

A <Color id="blue">Force Field Projector</Color> may be augmented with various modules. These general modules have the following effects:
- [<Color id="dark_purple">Scale Module</Color>](../scale_module.md): Adjusts the shape of a projected force field.
- [<Color id="dark_purple">Speed Module</Color>](../speed_module.md): Allows the Projector to generate a force field more quickly.
- [<Color id="dark_purple">Capacity Module</Color>](../capacity_module.md): Increases the amount of [Fortron](../fortron.md) the Projector is able to store.
