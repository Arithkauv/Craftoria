# Manometer

With a Manometer you can measure [pressure](../pressure.md) on a pneumatic network. Additionally, some Pneumatic machines/tubes have some special information about them. For instance, the [Safety Valve Tube Module](../safety_module.md) displays its safety threshold. So if you aren't feeling comfortable with redstone maths, this tool may be of use to you.
