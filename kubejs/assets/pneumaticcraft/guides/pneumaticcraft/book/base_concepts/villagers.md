# Mechanic Villagers

You have heard reports of a *villager* who stocks some interesting <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> components. Apparently he was involved in an accident with a [Pressure Chamber](../pressure_chamber.md)? Anyway, these days he prefers to hang out in his own house, which can be found in villages. Failing that, a [Charging Station](../charging_station.md) may prove enticing to unemployed villagers...
