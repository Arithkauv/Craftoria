Force fields can be used for a myriad of things, including: 
- Keeping intruders out of your house
- Building structures
- Creating underwater bases or airlocks
- Exterminating approaching mobs
- Capturing enemies in traps
- Protecting against ballistic missiles
- Confiscating items from players

MFFS also features configuration options that can <Color id="dark_aqua">remove its dependency on electrical energy</Color>, making it usable within vanilla Minecraft or in combination with other mods. MFFS is most commonly used in <Color id="dark_green">multi-player</Color> worlds, but certainly provides many benefits for <Color id="dark_green">single-player</Color> as well.
