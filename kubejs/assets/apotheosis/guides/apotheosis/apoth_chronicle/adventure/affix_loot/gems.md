# Gems

A <Color id="blue">Gem</Color> is a crystal of condensed strength.

When socketed into an affix item, a Gem will provide a powerful bonus.

Gems may give different bonuses in different items, and can be upgraded.

## Rarity

Like an Affix Item, each gem has a [Rarity](./rarities.md).

The rarity alone determines the strength of the gem, and higher rarity gems are more expensive to upgrade.

Gems cannot be upgraded past Ancient rarity.

## Obtaining Gems

Gems can be found in chest loot, and may rarely be found when killing mobs. However, for a gem to drop, the killer must be a real player, not a machine or other automation source.

Gems are more likely to drop from Bosses.

## Socketing Gems

To socket a gem into an item, combine the two in a Smithing Table.

Each gem states which items it may fit in.

Some gems are <Color hex="#C73912">Unique</Color>, meaning that only one copy of that gem may be socketed in an item.

## Removing Gems

Removing gems from an item was a difficult process, but some clever alchemists figured out how to do it.

Their notes are detailed on the next page.

## Sigil of Withdrawal

Combine a socketed item with a <Color id="blue">Sigil of Withdrawal</Color> in a smithing table to remove the socketed gems from an item. The item and all gems will be returned.
