# Stainless Steel

## Stainless Steel

Stainless Steel is the next material you will want a large quantity of. Read on to know why!

Smelting stainless steel dust in an EBF will give you hot ingots, which you can cool back into regular ingots with a Vacuum Freezer.

## Vacuum Freezer

You can check the base materials with EMI, and the exact shape with a wrench!

## Distillation Tower

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/distillation_tower_asbl" />

Once you get some digital circuits going, make sure to build a Distillation Tower. The Distillery only gives you one oil processing output, but the tower gives you ONE PER LAYER!

The above distillation tower is 3 layers tall, and would give you 3 outputs.

Distillation Tower can be up to 9 (+ bottom layer) layers tall.
