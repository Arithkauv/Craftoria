# GPS Tool

The *GPS Tool* is an item that when *right-clicked* on a block, saves the block's coordinate. This data is used in several places in <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>; see overleaf.

*Right-clicking* the *GPS Tool* in the air opens a GUI allowing coordinates to be adjusted directly.

Sneaking and scrolling the mouse wheel allows quick adjustment of the coordinate along the player's facing axis.

## Linking Global Variables

[Global Variables](../programming/variables.md#global) are an advanced [Drone](../base_concepts/drone.md) feature, accessed via the [Coordinate Operator](../programming/coordinate_operator.md).

*Right-clicking* a *GPS Tool* in the air allows a variable name to be entered.

Now, that *Global Variable* will track the value of the *GPS Tool's* selected coordinate. This can be used to make *Drone programs* that use dynamic areas.
