# Vortex Cannon

The *Vortex Cannon* is a weapon which shoots *vortices*: air spinning in a way that it doesn't have much friction and can be mostly stable.

You can use this to shoot gusts at the target of choice: to repel enemies, push animals around, uproot plants and leaves, or shear entities.

The higher the *Vortex Cannon* is pressurized, the more impact it has on its targets and the greater its range is.

Note that it's possible to catch yourself in a fired vortex, which can be very useful for fast transport. But beware: it provides no fall damage protection!
