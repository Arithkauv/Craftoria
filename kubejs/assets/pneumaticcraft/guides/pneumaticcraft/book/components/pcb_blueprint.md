# PCB Blueprint

The *PCB Blueprint* is a special component, required in the crafting of the [UV Light Box](../uv_light_box.md).

It cannot be crafted normally, but must be traded for, usually via the [Amadron Tablet](../amadron_tablet.md), but possibly also via [Mechanic Villagers](../villagers.md).

**TODO:** Unsupported Patchouli page type **pneumaticcraft:amadron_trade**
