# Air Compressor

The *Air Compressor* is a simple generator which can produce [compressed air](../base_concepts/pressure.md). It will burn any solid fuel that a vanilla *Furnace* will accept, to produce a <Color hex="#880">$(t:This can be increased by installing Speed Upgrades)base$(/t:This can be increased by installing Speed Upgrades)</Color> 10mL air/tick.

It will *not* accept *Lava Buckets* or indeed any bucket containing liquid fuels; use a [Liquid Compressor](./liquid_compressor.md) for that.
