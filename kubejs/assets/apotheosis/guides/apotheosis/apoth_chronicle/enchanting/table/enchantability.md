# Item Enchantability

In vanilla, an item's enchantability contributes to your <Color hex="#CC00CC">Final Power</Color>.

Apotheosis changes it to provide a direct <Color hex="#A800A8">Arcana</Color> boost instead.

<Color hex="#A800A8">Arcana</Color> is increased by 50% of an item's enchantability.
