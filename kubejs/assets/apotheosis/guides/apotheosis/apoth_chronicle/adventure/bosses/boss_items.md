# Boss Items

Every boss is empowered with exactly one affix item, alongside the rest of their fully enchanted gear.

This affix item is guaranteed to be dropped on death, and has a higher chance to be of a higher rarity than other sources of affix loot.

This item alone is the trophy you will take from slaying a boss, and it is likely to be worth it.

As a memento of the original owner, every boss item will have the boss's name prefixed to the item's name.
