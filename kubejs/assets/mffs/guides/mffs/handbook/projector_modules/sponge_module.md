# Sponge Module

<ItemImage id="mffs:sponge_module" />

Placing a <Color id="dark_purple">Sponge Module</Color> in a [Force Field Projector](../machines/projector.md) makes it continually detect and remove any fluids contained within the field. The rate at which fluids are removed can be increased by installing [<Color id="dark_purple">Speed Module</Color>](../upgrade_modules/speed_module.md)s. Higher rates may be needed for removing infinite fluids, such as Water.

Crafting the <Color id="dark_purple">Sponge Module</Color>.
