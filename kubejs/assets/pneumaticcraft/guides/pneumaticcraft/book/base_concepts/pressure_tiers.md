# Pressure Tiers

<Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> currently has three *tiers* for pneumatic machines:
- *Tier one* machines are capable of nominally resisting 5 bar of pressure.
- *Tier one-point-five* machines can resist up to 10 bar.
- *Tier two* machines can resist up to 20 bar.

Tier 1.5 is a new "tier" added in the MC 1.18 release of <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color>. It's an optional tier, mainly intended to access some functionality which was previously tier 2 only:
- Charging tools to 10 bar
- Obtaining a *Diamond Drill Bit* (which allows 3x3 block breaking; this used to require a *Netherite Drill Bit*)

## Gauge Pressure

Note that *bar* as used by <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> represents the pressure **above** normal atmospheric pressure, so 0 bar is unpressurized air, and -1 bar is a vacuum. This is also known as *Gauge Pressure*.
