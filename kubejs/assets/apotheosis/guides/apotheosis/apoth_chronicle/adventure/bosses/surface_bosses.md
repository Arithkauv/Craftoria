# Invading Bosses

A strange noise, a peculiar message, and a giant beam of light from the sky...

All signs point to a Boss, actively invading your world.

As opposed to bosses that are found in dungeons, invading bosses may rarely show up on the surface where mobs can normally spawn.

Their arrival will be marked by a loud noise, a status message, and a beacon that briefly emanates from their spawn point.
