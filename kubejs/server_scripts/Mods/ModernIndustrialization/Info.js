      `The cost being 1mb of UU-Matter per item replicated.`,
      `But there's a catch, it can't replicate items that contain other items, like backpacks or shulker boxes, as you cannot create matter from nothing.`,

    'modern_industrialization:replicator_2': [
      `An "improved" version of the original Replicator, capable of replicating items much faster, but it consumes power now.`,
      `It's also capable of replicating some items that the "basic" Replicator can't.`,

      `Simply insert up to 64 identical single-block machines into the GUI of the Processing Array to supercharge your production.`,
      `The more machines you add, the more recipes are processed, but be warnedâ€”it will demand a significant amount of energy!`,

      `Are those massive multiblock machines just not cutting it in terms of speed?`,

      `This machine can parallelize the processing of recipes, allowing it to process up to 64 times faster than a single machine!`,
      `Simply place the multiblock controllers of the desired machine into the GUI of the Multi-Processing Array to link them together.`,
      `But keep in mind, such efficiency comes at a steep energy cost!`,
      `With the Multi-Processing Array, you can scale up your production without cluttering your base with those massive multiblocks.`,
