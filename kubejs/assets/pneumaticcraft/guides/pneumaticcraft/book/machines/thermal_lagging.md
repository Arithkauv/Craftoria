# Thermal Lagging

As you're probably aware, <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> machines which use [Heat](../base_concepts/heat.md) will lose heat to the air, if left exposed. While you can cover these machines with pretty much any non-air, non-heat-conducting block, *Thermal Lagging* is particularly suitable for insulating machines.

*Thermal Lagging* has the useful property of allowing you to *click through* to the block behind, as if the lagging wasn't even present.

This applies unless you are holding any type of *Pickaxe*, *wrench*, or you are *sneaking*, which lets you target the lagging itself for removal or other interaction.
