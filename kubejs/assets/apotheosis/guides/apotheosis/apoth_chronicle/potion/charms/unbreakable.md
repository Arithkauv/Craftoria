# Unbreakable Charms

Through [Infusion Enchanting](../../infusion.md), charms can be made Unbreakable.

Through this, you can have unlimited duration of any potion effect.

The infusion recipe for Unbreakable charms is rather difficult.

You'll need a firm understanding of [Enchanting Stats](../../stats.md) to be able to complete it.
