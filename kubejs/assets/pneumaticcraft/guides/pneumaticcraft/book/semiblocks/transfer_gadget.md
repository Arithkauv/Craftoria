# Transfer Gadget

The *Transfer Gadget* is a rather basic item/fluid transfer item. It can be placed *between* two inventories or tanks to transfer between them. The best way to place it is to first place down one inventory, then right click the side of that block with a *Transfer Gadget*, then place the second inventory.

The Transfer Gadget will have one of two colors:
- <Color id="gold">Orange</Color> - output mode
- <Color id="blue">Blue</Color> - input mode.

An <Color id="gold">output mode</Color> gadget extracts from the inventory/tank it's placed on, inserting to the neighbouring block, and an <Color id="blue">input mode</Color> gadget does the opposite. Resources are transferred at a rate of 1 item or 100mB fluid every 2 seconds.

*Right-click* the *Transfer Gadget* with an empty hand or a [Logistics Configurator](../tools/logistics_configurator.md) to toggle input/output mode. *Sneak+right-click* (or left-click - hit) to remove the *Transfer Gadget*.

Because of its low speed and cheap recipe, this is ideal for early-game item/fluid transfer where space might be limited.
