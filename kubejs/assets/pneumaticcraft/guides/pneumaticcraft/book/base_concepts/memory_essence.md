# Memory Essence

*Memory Essence* is a fluid which represents a player's memories and experiences in liquid form. It can be extracted and stored for later use, either for vanilla enchanting, or for certain <Color hex="#228">PneumaticCraft: Repressurized</Color> crafting processes.

There are two ways to obtain *Memory Essence*:
- 1. With a [Memory Stick](../tools/memory_stick.md)
- 2. With an [Aerial Interface](../machines/aerial_interface.md).
