# Air Cannon

The *Air Cannon* is a device you can use to transport items quite some distance, through the air. It uses [compressed air](../pressure.md) as propellant.

You will also need a [GPS Tool](../gps_tool.md) to aim the *Air Cannon* (although the GPS Tool can be removed and re-used once the Cannon is aimed).

A <Color hex="#f00">redstone pulse</Color> will trigger the Cannon to fire.

## Upgrades

With a [Dispenser Upgrade](../upgrades.md#dispenser) installed, the *Air Cannon* behaves like a vanilla *Dispenser* for certain items, e.g. TNT or Fire Charges.

With an [Entity Tracker Upgrade](../upgrades.md#entity_tracker), the *Air Cannon* will not launch items from its inventory, but instead launch the nearest entity (including you!) when triggered.
